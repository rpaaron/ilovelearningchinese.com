<p>你好！Welcome to ilovelearningchinese.com</p>
<p>You somehow were able to stumble into our Chinese learning website and thank you for giving us a try. Our learning philosophy is to let the language learner to study at his/her own pace through listening, reading and repetition.  With enough exposure you will gain confidence to learn more on your own and immerse yourself in Chinese.</p>
<h1>This Site Was Made to Help You Learn Chinese</h1>
<p>We are building a website where one can start building blocks into learning Chinese.  The  Chinese language is one of the most difficult languages to learn in the world and we want to make it feasible for anyone wanting to learn.  We are in the process of creating a comprehensive Chinese learning site so that a beginner or even a veteran in Chinese can come and learn to the next level.</p>
<h2>How to Start Learning Chinese</h2>
<p><a href="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/baby.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-353 alignleft" src="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/baby-e1402409532815.jpg" alt="baby" width="300" height="175" /></a>If you are just starting to learn Chinese, you can start taking your baby steps by listening to  <a title="Level 1 Lesson 1 / Hello! / 你好！" href="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/?p=1">Level 1 Lesson 1</a> and learn greetings and some words.  You will start to love learning Chinese because you will find that you will start to feel more comfortable with the language.  We recommend that you learn pinyin which is the romanized spelling for reading Chinese in <a title="Level 0 Pinyin – Chinese Phonetic Alphabets / 拼音" href="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/?page_id=535">Level 0</a> because once you can read the romanized spelling you will be able to look up any Chinese character and learn to read it.</p>

<p><a href="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pdf_sample-e1402412224848.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-365 alignleft" src="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pdf_sample-e1402412224848.jpg" alt="pdf_sample" width="200" height="157" /></a></p>
<p>You may think that learning the language by just listening to podcasts can be  overwhelming so we recommend that you<strong> look at the PDF</strong> that is made available on the Notes tab with each lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/vocab_sample-e1402412574175.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-367" src="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/vocab_sample-e1402412574175.jpg" alt="vocab_sample" width="250" height="107" /></a>We want you to have as much practice as you can get, so look at the words and sentences individually.  Here we<strong> line-by-line recordings</strong> so you can carefully listen and practice saying them out loud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/flashcard_sample-e1402413955636.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-373 alignleft" src="http://ilovelearningchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/flashcard_sample-e1402413955636.jpg" alt="flashcard_sample" width="214" height="178" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Flashcards</strong> are a great way to test yourself.  With each lesson there will be a review tab in which the lesson&#8217;s vocab and sentences will be placed in each flashcard.  Be sure to review as much as you can the flashcard tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
